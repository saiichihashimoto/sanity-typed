Completing [sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)'s developer experience with typescript (and more)!

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Features

This project aims to complete sanity's developer experience with (almost) completely drop-in solutions. It's scope includes:

1. Typescript for all Sanity results

- [x] [Typed Sanity Documents](packages/types)
- [x] [Typed GROQ Queries](packages/groq)
- [x] [Typed Sanity Client](packages/client)

2. Fully local development environment

- [x] [Mocked Sanity Documents](packages/faker)
- [x] [Local GROQ execution](packages/groq-js)
- [x] [Mocked Sanity Client](packages/client-mock)

3. Runtime safety for all Sanity results

- [x] [Sanity Documents Zod Parser](packages/zod)
- [ ] [GROQ Queries Zod Parser](https://github.com/saiichihashimoto/sanity-typed/issues/306)

With the full suite, everything would be fully typed, runtime safe, and fully local. The drop-in nature means that working these solutions into native sanity is a possibility and keeps new documentation and learning curve to a minimum.

npm install sanity @sanity-typed/client @sanity-typed/types
