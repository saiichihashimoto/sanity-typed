[@portabletext/react](https://github.com/portabletext/react) with typed arguments

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Install

```bash
npm install @portabletext/react @portabletext-typed/react
```

## Usage

After using [@sanity-typed/types](../types) and [@sanity-typed/client](../client) and you have typed blocks, use `PortableText` from this library as you would from [`@portabletext/react`](https://github.com/portabletext/react) to get fully typed arguments!
