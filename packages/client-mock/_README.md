Mock [@sanity-typed/client](../client) for local development and testing

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Install

```bash
npm install sanity @sanity-typed/client-mock
```

## Usage

Use `createClient` instead of the `createClient` from [`@sanity-typed/client`](../client) and include initial documents.

@[typescript](../example-studio/schemas/product.ts)
@[typescript](../example-studio/sanity.config.ts)
@[typescript](../example-app/src/sanity/mocked-client.ts)

Depending on your tree-shaking setup, you'll want to swap between the real client and the mock client. Additionally, using [`@sanity-typed/faker`](../faker) along with the mock client can be a great way to generate fake data.

## Breaking Changes

### 3 to 4

#### Typescript version from 5.7.2 <= x <= 5.7.3

The supported Typescript version is now 5.7.2 <= x <= 5.7.3. Older versions are no longer supported and newer versions will be added as we validate them.

### 2 to 3

#### Typescript version from 5.4.2 <= x <= 5.6.3

The supported Typescript version is now 5.4.2 <= x <= 5.6.3. Older versions are no longer supported and newer versions will be added as we validate them.

### 1 to 2

#### No more `createClient<SanityValues>()(config)`

Removing the double function signature from `createClient` and renaming `dataset` to `documents`:

```diff
- const client = createClient<SanityValues>({
-   dataset: [/* ... */],
- })({
+ const client = createClient<SanityValues>({
+ documents: [/* ... */],
  dataset: "production",
  // ...
});
```

We no longer derive types from your config values. Most of the types weren't significant, but the main loss will be `_originalId` when the `perspective` was `"previewDrafts"`.
