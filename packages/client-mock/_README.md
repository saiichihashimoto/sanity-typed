Mock [@sanity-typed/client](../client) for local development and testing

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Install

```bash
npm install sanity @sanity-typed/client-mock
```

## Usage

Use `createClient` instead of the `createClient` from [`@sanity-typed/client`](../client) and include initial documents.

@[typescript](../../docs/schemas/product.ts)
@[typescript](../../docs/sanity.config.ts)
@[typescript](../../docs/your-super-cool-mocked-application.ts)

Depending on your tree-shaking setup, you'll want to swap between the real client and the mock client. Additionally, using [`@sanity-typed/faker`](../faker) along with the mock client can be a great way to generate fake data.

@[typescript](../../docs/your-super-cool-fully-mocked-application.ts)

## Alternatives

- [`fake-sanity-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fake-sanity-client)
