Mock [@sanity-typed/client](../client) for local development and testing

## Install

```bash
npm install sanity @sanity-typed/client-mock
```

## Usage

Use `createClient` instead of the `createClient` from [`@sanity-typed/client`](../client) and include initial documents.

@[typescript](../example-studio/schemas/product.ts)
@[typescript](../example-studio/sanity.config.ts)
@[typescript](../example-app/src/sanity/mocked-client.ts)

Depending on your tree-shaking setup, you'll want to swap between the real client and the mock client. Additionally, using [`@sanity-typed/faker`](../faker) along with the mock client can be a great way to generate fake data.

@[typescript](../example-app/src/sanity/mocks.ts)
@[typescript](../example-app/src/sanity/swapping-client.ts)
