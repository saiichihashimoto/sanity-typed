## Usage

Use `createClient` instead of the `createClient` from [`@sanity-typed/client`](../client) and include initial documents.

Depending on your tree-shaking setup, you'll want to swap between the real client and the mock client. Additionally, using [`@sanity-typed/faker`](../faker) along with the mock client can be a great way to generate fake data.

<!-- >>>>>> BEGIN INCLUDED FILE (typescript): SOURCE packages/example-app/src/sanity/mocks.ts -->
```mocks.ts```:
```typescript
import { base, en } from "@faker-js/faker";
import config from "sanity.config";

import { sanityConfigToFaker, sanityDocumentsFaker } from "@sanity-typed/faker";

export const getMockDataset = () => {
  const sanityFaker = sanityConfigToFaker(config, {
    faker: { locale: [en, base] },
  });
  /**
   *  typeof sanityFaker === {
   *    [type in keyof SanityValues]: () => SanityValues[type];
   *  }
   */

  const documentsFaker = sanityDocumentsFaker(config, sanityFaker);
  /**
   *  typeof documentsFaker === () => SanityValues[keyof SanityValues][]
   */

  return documentsFaker();
};

## Considerations

<!-- >>>>>> BEGIN INCLUDED FILE (markdown): SOURCE docs/considerations/evaluate-type-flakiness.md -->
### GROQ Query results changes in seemingly breaking ways

Similar to [parsing](#the-parsed-tree-changes-in-seemingly-breaking-ways), evaluating groq queries will attempt to match how sanity actually evaluates queries. Again, any fixes to match that or changes to groq evaluation will likely not be considered a major change but, rather, a bug fix.

### `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`

You might run into the dreaded `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite` error when writing GROQ queries. This isn't [too uncommon with more complex GROQ queries](https://github.com/saiichihashimoto/sanity-typed/issues?q=is%3Aissue+instantiation+is%3Aclosed). Unfortunately, this isn't a completely avoidable problem, as typescript has limits on complexity and parsing types from a string is an inherently complex problem. A set of steps for a workaround:

1. While not ideal, use [`@ts-expect-error`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html#-ts-expect-error-comments) to disable the error. You could use [`@ts-ignore` instead](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html#ts-ignore-or-ts-expect-error), but ideally you'd like to remove the comment if a fix is released.
2. You still likely want manual types. Intersect the returned type with whatever is missing as a patch.
3. Create a PR in [`groq/src/specific-issues.test.ts`](../groq/src/specific-issues.test.ts) with your issue. [#642](https://github.com/saiichihashimoto/sanity-typed/pull/642/files) is a great example for this. Try to reduce your query and config as much as possible. The goal is a minimal reproduction.
4. If a PR isn't possible, make an issue with the same content. ie, the query and config you're using. Again, reduce them as much as possible. And then, now that you've done all the work, move it into a PR instead!
5. I'm one person and some of these issues are quite complex. Take a stab at fixing the bug! There's a ridiculous amount of tests so it's relatively safe to try things out.

People will sometimes create a repo with their issue. _Please_ open a PR with a minimal test instead. Without a PR there will be no tests reflecting your issue and it may appear again in a regression. Forking a github repo to make a PR is a more welcome way to contribute to an open source library.

## Breaking Changes

### 1 to 2

#### No more `createClient<SanityValues>()(config)`

Removing the double function signature from `createClient` and renaming `dataset` to `documents`:

```diff
- const client = createClient<SanityValues>({
-   dataset: [/* ... */],
- })({
+ const client = createClient<SanityValues>({
+ documents: [/* ... */],
  dataset: "production",
  // ...
});
```

We no longer derive types from your config values. Most of the types weren't significant, but the main loss will be `_originalId` when the `perspective` was `"previewDrafts"`.
