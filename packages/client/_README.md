Typed Sanity Client Results, all inferred, no client changes!

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Install

```bash
npm install sanity @sanity-typed/client
```

## Usage

Use `createClient` exactly as you would from [`@sanity/client`](https://github.com/sanity-io/client) with a minor change for proper type inference.

@[typescript](../types/docs/schemas/product.ts)
@[typescript](../types/docs/sanity.config.ts)
@[typescript](docs/your-super-cool-application.ts)

The `createClient<SanityValues>()(config)` syntax is due to having to infer one generic (the config shape) while explicitly providing the Sanity Values' type, [which can't be done in the same generics](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571).
