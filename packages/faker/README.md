### Features

- `reference._ref` will point to the correct `document._id`, so you can use [`groq-js` or `@sanity-typed/groq-js`](../groq-js) and be certain that your references will work.
  - How this works is that, for any `sanityConfigToFaker(...).type()`, the first 5 documents will have references that only point to ids of the first 5 documents of that type. For example, if type `foo` had references that pointed to type `bar`, then all references in the first 5 mocks of `foo` could only point to the first 5 mocks of `bar`. If you want to change this number, pass a different `referencedChunkSize` to `sanityConfigToFaker(config, { faker, referencedChunkSize })`. The [tests for this](./src/document-id-memo.test.ts) are a good explanation.
  - TLDR, mock 5 of every document, all their references will point to each other. If you want more or less, change `referencedChunkSize`.
- Any field's mocked values should stay consistent, even as you change the other fields. If you're using `slug` for url paths, this will keep your emails consistent as schemas change.
  - Fakers are instantiated per schema type with a seed corresponding to the field's path. This will hopefully keep "mock flux" to a minimum, so only fields you change should generate new mock data. The [tests for this](./src/consistency.test.ts) are a good explanation.

## Considerations

<!-- >>>>>> BEGIN INCLUDED FILE (markdown): SOURCE docs/considerations/config-in-runtime.md -->
### Config in Runtime

`@sanity-typed/*` generally has the goal of only having effect to types and no runtime effects. This package is an exception. This means that you will have to import your sanity config to use this. While sanity v3 is better than v2 at having a standard build environment, you will have to handle any nuances, including having a much larger build.
