Infer [GROQ](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq) Result Types from GROQ strings

## Install

```bash
npm install @sanity-typed/groq
```

## Usage

Typically, this isn't used directly, but via [`@sanity-typed/client`'s](../client) and [`@sanity-typed/groq-js`'s](../groq-js) methods that use groq strings. But it can be done directly:

```typescript
import { ExecuteQuery } from "@sanity-typed/groq";

type Foo = ExecuteQuery<
  '*[_type=="foo"]',
  {
    dataset: ({ _type: "bar" } | { _type: "foo" })[];
    // If you have SanityValues from @sanity-typed/types, use those types:
    // dataset: Extract<SanityValues[keyof SanityValues], Omit<SanityDocument, "_type">>[]
  }
>;
/**
 *  Foo === {
 *    _type: "foo";
 *  }[]
 */
```

There is also a `Parse` and `Evaluate` if you need the AST:

```typescript
import { Evaluate, Parse } from "@sanity-typed/groq";

type Tree = Parse<'*[_type=="foo"]'>;
/**
 *  Tree === {
 *    type: "Filter";
 *    base: { type: "Everything" };
 *    expr: {
 *      type: "OpCall";
 *      op: "==";
 *      left: { type: "AccessAttribute"; name: "_type" };
 *      right: { type: "Value"; value: "foo" };
 *    };
 *  }
 */

type Foo = Evaluate<
  Tree,
  {
    dataset: ({ _type: "bar" } | { _type: "foo" })[];
    // If you have SanityValues from @sanity-typed/types, use those types:
    // dataset: Extract<SanityValues[keyof SanityValues], Omit<SanityDocument, "_type">>[]
  }
>;
/**
 *  Foo === {
 *    _type: "foo";
 *  }[]
 */
```

Chances are, you don't need this package directly.

## Considerations

<!-- >>>>>> BEGIN INCLUDED FILE (markdown): SOURCE packages/groq/docs/considerations/docs/considerations/parse-type-flakiness.md -->
### The parsed tree changes in seemingly breaking ways

`@sanity-typed/groq` attempts to type its parsed types as close as possible to [`groq-js`](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-js)'s `parse` function output. Any fixes to match it more correctly won't be considered a major change and, if `groq-js` changes it's output in a version update, we're likely to match it. If you're using the parsed tree's types directly, this might cause your code to break. We don't consider this a breaking change because the intent of these groq libraries is to match the types of a groq query as closely as possible.
