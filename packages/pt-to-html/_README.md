[@portabletext/to-html](https://github.com/portabletext/to-html) with typed arguments

@[:page_toc](## Page Contents)

## Install

```bash
npm install @portabletext/to-html @portabletext-typed/to-html
```

## Usage

After using [@sanity-typed/types](../types) and [@sanity-typed/client](../client) and you have typed blocks, use `toHTML` from this library as you would from [`@portabletext/to-html`](https://github.com/portabletext/to-html) to get fully typed arguments!

## Breaking Changes

### 1 to 2

#### Typescript version from 5.4.2 <= x <= 5.6.3

The supported Typescript version is now 5.4.2 <= x <= 5.6.3. Older versions are no longer supported and newer versions will be added as we validate it.
